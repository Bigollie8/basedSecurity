                <p>
                    basedSecurity is a Lua loader service offered on an
                    application-based system.

                <h2>What are we trying to accomplish?</h2>
                <p>
                    This was a fun project that I wanted to tackle and attempt
                    to learn more about a topic I had not explored. I believe I
                    have created a service that will allow people to securely
                    share their scripts with their friends.
                </p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Is basedSecurity uncrackable?</h2>
                <p>
                    No, nothing is uncrackable, but the security we provide is
                    far from your basic system. Someone with a very high
                    skillset could possibly crack it, but I am constantly
                    working on tamper detection and other means to prevent such
                    attacks to help protect your script.

            <div class="section">
                <h2>How do I know you wonâ€™t leak my script?</h2>
                <p>
                    I initially tackled this project to practice and make my own
                    loader! My goal is not to collect scripts, but to learn as
                    much as I can and provide a worthwhile service to an active
                    user base. I am always open to feedback and will be trying
                    to improve the security as needed.

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Do you protect any script?</h2>
                <p>
                    From full-on rage scripts to cool visual scripts, we will
                    protect anything. Currently, we are only opening 5 beta
                    slots, but we will look to expand in the future.

                <h2>This sounds great! Where can I apply?</h2>
                <p>
                    Fill out the Google form. It will be reviewed by staff to
                    see if it qualifies for a beta slot.
